# Milestone-Project
This project is about the analysis of the Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index Dataset from the NASA STEM Search. I analyzed the trends of temperature anomalies and made conclusions based on the results of the visualizations. This project is meant to show the rapid rate of global warming that has been shown in the past few decades. 

There are 9 files in this repository. The first is the future_temperature_projections.csv, which is for the projection graph that predicts future temperature anomalies. The second and third files are the uncleaned and cleaned spreadsheets, global-land-oceantempindex.xlsx, the uncleaned excel file, and global-land-oceantempindex_cleaned.csv, the cleaned CSV file.
Then, there are 3 milestone files, Milestone 2, 3, & 4 (MitraIyer_Milestone2.ipynb, MitraIyer_Milestone3.ipynb, MitraIyer_Milestone4.ipynb). These files are the milestones for this project, 2 getting information about the data, 3 cleaning the data, and 4 graphing the first two graphs. The final project file MitraIyer_FinalProject.ipynb is all 4 of the visualizations using the cleaned data. The 1 Page summary file, MitraIyer_OnePageSummary is a one page write-up of the project, questions, methodology, purpose, results, and future work. The presentation file MitraIyer_FinalProjectPresentation is a presentation detailing the project and results.
